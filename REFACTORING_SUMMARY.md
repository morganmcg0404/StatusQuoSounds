# StatusQuoSounds Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The StatusQuoSounds plugin has been completely refactored to follow the architecture of the C Engineer: Completed plugin. This brings significant improvements in usability, maintainability, and user experience.

## Key Changes

### 1. External Sound File Storage
- **Before**: Sound files embedded in JAR resources (not user-customizable)
- **After**: Sound files stored in `.runelite/statusquosounds-sounds/` directory (fully customizable)
- **Benefit**: Users can easily replace sound files with their own custom sounds

### 2. Enhanced Configuration Structure
- **Before**: Basic sections with limited options (0-100% volume)
- **After**: Granular sections with more event types (0-200% volume like C Engineer)
- **New Sections**:
  - Achievement Sounds (level ups, quests, collection log, diaries, combat achievements)
  - Drop Sounds (pets, rare drops, superior spawns, configurable threshold)
  - General Settings (chat notifications, volume control)

### 3. Modular Architecture
- **Before**: Monolithic plugin class with embedded logic
- **After**: Separate classes for different responsibilities:
  - `SoundType.java` - Enum defining all sound variants
  - `SoundEngine.java` - Audio playback with volume control
  - `SoundFileManager.java` - File management and extraction
  - `EventTriggers.java` - Event detection and handling

### 4. Enhanced Sound System
- **Before**: 3 random variants per event type from JAR resources
- **After**: 3 random variants per event type from user directory
- **New Features**:
  - Automatic default sound extraction
  - Custom sound file validation
  - Fallback to system beep for missing files
  - Volume scaling with logarithmic formula (like C Engineer)

### 5. Expanded Event Support
- **New Events Added**:
  - Level ups (any skill)
  - Quest completions
- **Existing Events Enhanced**:
  - Collection log entries
  - Pet drops  
  - Rare drops (with configurable GP threshold)
  - Superior slayer spawns
  - Achievement diary completions
  - Combat achievement completions

### 6. Chat Notification System
- **New Feature**: Optional fake chat messages for events
- **Format**: `[StatusQuoSounds] <event description>`
- **Benefit**: Visual confirmation that events were detected
- **Default**: Disabled to avoid chat spam

### 7. Improved Volume Control
- **Before**: 0-100% range with basic scaling
- **After**: 0-200% range with logarithmic scaling (matching C Engineer)
- **New Feature**: Volume test sound when changing settings

### 8. Better File Management
- **Automatic Directory Creation**: Creates `.runelite/statusquosounds-sounds/` on startup
- **Default Sound Extraction**: Extracts default sounds if missing
- **Info File**: Creates helpful documentation file in sounds directory
- **Placeholder System**: Creates `.missing` files for missing default sounds

## File Structure Changes

### Before
```
src/main/java/com/statusquosounds/
├── StatusQuoSoundsPlugin.java (everything in one file)
└── StatusQuoSoundsConfig.java (basic config)
```

### After
```
src/main/java/com/statusquosounds/
├── StatusQuoSoundsPlugin.java (main plugin class)
├── StatusQuoSoundsConfig.java (enhanced config)
├── sound/
│   ├── SoundType.java (sound enumeration)
│   ├── SoundEngine.java (audio playback)
│   └── SoundFileManager.java (file management)
└── triggers/
    └── EventTriggers.java (event detection)
```

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Easy Customization
- Users can simply replace `.wav` files in the sounds directory
- No need to rebuild the plugin or modify JARs
- Supports any `.wav` format audio files

### 2. Better Configuration
- More granular control over individual event types
- Volume range matches other popular plugins (C Engineer)
- Optional chat notifications for event confirmation

### 3. Robust Error Handling
- Missing sound files fall back to system beep
- File corruption doesn't crash the plugin
- Clear logging for troubleshooting

### 4. Professional Documentation
- Comprehensive README with installation and customization guide
- Detailed USAGE.md with configuration options and troubleshooting
- Info file created in sounds directory with file name reference

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Clean Architecture
- Separation of concerns across multiple classes
- Event-driven design with proper dependency injection
- Testable components with clear interfaces

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Asynchronous sound playback
- Efficient file existence checking
- Memory-conscious audio handling

### 3. Error Resilience
- Graceful degradation when sound files are missing
- Proper resource cleanup and error handling
- Logging for debugging without spam

### 4. Extensibility
- Easy to add new event types via enum extension
- Modular event detection system
- Configurable thresholds and settings

## Migration Notes

### For Users
- Existing configurations will need to be reconfigured (due to structure changes)
- Sound files now stored externally for easy customization
- New event types available (level ups, quest completions)
- Volume range expanded to 0-200%

### For Developers
- Code is now much more maintainable and extensible
- Clear separation between different functional areas
- Follows established RuneLite plugin patterns
- Easy to add new sound events or configuration options

## Credits

This refactoring was inspired by the excellent architecture of the [C Engineer: Completed](https://github.com/m0bilebtw/c-engineer-completed) plugin, which demonstrates best practices for:
- External sound file management
- User-friendly customization
- Robust configuration systems
- Professional plugin architecture

The refactoring maintains the original vision of StatusQuoSounds while bringing it up to modern RuneLite plugin standards and user expectations.
